# PREDICTIVE-ANALYTICS-ON-AIR-TRAFFIC-PASSENGER-DATA
Predictive Analytics on Air Traffic Passenger Data using Python. The project performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to uncover trends. Supervised models (Linear Regression, Random Forest) predict passenger count, while K-Means clustering identifies hidden patterns and passenger segments.
Objective 1: Passenger Trend Over Years

Year-wise aggregation of passenger count was performed to analyze long-term trends in air traffic. A line chart visualization was used to represent passenger movement over different years.

Result: Passenger traffic shows noticeable variation across years, reflecting changes in demand, travel patterns, and operational factors.

Objective 2: Passenger Count by GEO Region

Passenger counts were grouped by geographic regions to identify regions contributing the highest traffic volume. A bar chart was used to visualize regional differences.

Result: Certain regions contribute significantly more passengers, indicating major travel hubs.

Objective 3: Price Category Distribution

A pie chart was used to analyze passenger distribution across different price categories.

Result: The majority of passengers belong to standard price categories, indicating cost-sensitive travel behavior.

Objective 4: Terminal-wise Passenger Distribution

Terminal-wise passenger distribution was analyzed using a box plot to identify traffic imbalance among terminals.

Result: Some terminals experience significantly higher traffic, indicating uneven passenger distribution.

# PREDICTIVE-ANALYTICS-ON-AIR-TRAFFIC-PASSENGER-DATA
Predictive Analytics on Air Traffic Passenger Data using Python. The project performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to uncover trends. Supervised models (Linear Regression, Random Forest) predict passenger count, while K-Means clustering identifies hidden patterns and passenger segments.
